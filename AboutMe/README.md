# Understanding views and XML

This is the toy app for lesson 3 of the [Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012).

## About Me

This is an app that takes little interaction with the user. It is made mainly for getting familiarized with XML and views on Android environment, so it only takes some elements on Main Activity to build a scroll bar with can be used to read along text. Check [screenshots](#Screenshots) to see more.
