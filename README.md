# Learning-Android-Kotlin
This is my repository for simple projects made to learn Android. All projects here are from the Google Android course called Developing Android Apps with Kotlin, and you
can find the course [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940).

# Running
To run any of these apps, clone this repository, open the desired app and build it with gradle. You can download it to your Android device when you build it on Android Studio too.

# Projects
## Trivia App
This is an app designed to test the user knowledge on basic Android concepts. There are multiple screens, and the user can navigate through each of them as he gets right answers on
the test.

The app uses concepts of Navigation.

# Note
You can find a better description of each project on its own README file.
