# Learning-Android-Kotlin
This is my repository for simple projects made to learn Android. All projects here are from the Google Android course called Developing Android Apps with Kotlin, and you
can find the course [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940).

# Running
To run any of these apps, clone this repository, open the desired app and build it with gradle. You can download it to your Android device when you build it on Android Studio too.

# Projects

## Dice Roller
This was my "Hello World" from Android. I got almost everything done from the course, and I become more familiar with working with XML and using Kotlin to change views.

## About Me
In this project I understood more about how XML works and built a simple "personal card" as an App.

## Color my Views
This as is very simple and is not interactive. It only shows some blocks of text, which are combined with "good practices for building view on XML". I learned about not hardcoding values for positioning the views on the screen, which is core for developing any app.

## Trivia App
This is an app designed to test the user knowledge on basic Android concepts. There are multiple screens, and the user can navigate through each of them as he gets right answers on
the test.

The app uses concepts of Navigation. You can check more details [here](https://github.com/ottusp/Learning-Android-Kotlin/tree/main/TriviaApp).

## Dessert Pusher
This is a game simpler than the old fashioned Cookie Clicker, and the game consists in the same idea: make points by clicking in an image. The purpose of this project was to learn about LifeCycle, and how the Android OS uses it to enhance performance. I could learn about the View functions onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop() and onDestroy(), as well as to save data on changing states (like when rotating the phone).

## Guess it App
This is a simple game of guessing the word that appears on the screen. With this project, I learned about the architecture MVVM, and learned how to implement ViewModel classes in Android.

I also learned about the Observer pattern and got more used to binding data that appears on on view to its Model.

You can check more details [here](https://github.com/ottusp/Learning-Android-Kotlin/tree/main/GuessIt).

# Note
You can find a better description of each project on its own README file.
